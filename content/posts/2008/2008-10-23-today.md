Today.

Today we are better than yesterday, but not as good as we will be tomorrow.

Today our tools are better than they were yesterday, but not as good as they will be tomorrow.

We build software today.

This is an important thing to remember as a software developer. When we look at the code we wrote yesterday, when we look forward to the code we will write tomorrow.

Every day we choose how we will be better tomorrow, with better knowledge or better tools.

The map to tomorrow is littered with roads, directions, and markers that point the way to new places. These new places each call to us in hopes that we will choose it over its competitors.

As a software developer, we struggle to find tomorrows improvement in this cacophony.

But today, we write code as best we can, today.
