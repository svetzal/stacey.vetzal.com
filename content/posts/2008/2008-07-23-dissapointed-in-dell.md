I leased a nice Dell server this year to help stabilize our IT infrastructure at Three Wise Men. With it I purchased "next business day onsite service".

On Monday this week I arrived at work to find two hard drives dead which broke our RAID storage. So I arranged a service call to replace the drives yesterday and promised my customer we would resume testing today.

So, needless to say Dell made me a liar. They never came yesterday which has now put me three days behind.

What's the point of paying for service if Dell can't deliver on it?
