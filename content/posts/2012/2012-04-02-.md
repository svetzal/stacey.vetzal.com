In 2009, I wrote about my experience with PMP.

Since then, I get posts every month or two from others who are going through their own journeys. I'm happy to have provided my perspective, and I thought folks might like to read a follow-up.

My story is a happy one. Three years ago I was laying in bed about this time, wishing the wound from where my stitches opened would heal faster, hating my ileostomy.

Today I'm happy and healthy. I go for annual ultrasounds and chest x-rays now instead of the quarterly CT scans.

I have undergone one additional shift in my life, this experience gave me the courage and conviction to finally come out as transgender. I live now as my felt-gender, as a woman.
