You know, as much as Agile gets a bad rap for companies that poorly or inconsistently implement it, I absolutely hate to see [Waterfall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) done badly. It's like they see [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) done badly, point their fingers and go running back into their hole to practice Waterfall again, except that they're doing Waterfall badly too.

And they wonder why their IT projects are costly and always slipping.

Oh, and for the record, Agile isn't Waterfall with sloppy schedules that everyone has to adapt to. Ugh.

Do others see this anti-pattern? Sloppy Waterfall being labelled Agile?
