This started as a post about how Java EE 5 has improved my experience in writing webservices based applications.

However, for the past hour I've been sitting fighting with this crazy WYSIWYG editor (I've [blogged before](http://svetzal.wordpress.com/category/opinion/page/8/) about how much I HATE browser-based editors) trying to get the simplest code snippet into my blog entry.

So I gave up writing that post and wrote this one instead. So there!

I'm not the first person to have this problem, so speak up! How the hell did you solve it?
