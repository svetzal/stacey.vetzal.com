So, I've been lurking around various places in the devops world over the years, and lately I've been cruising job postings related to it. I had a conversation last Friday with a colleague, and during I began to wax philosophical about the purview of devops. Afterwards I realized I'd touched on something that I haven't seem much discussion around.

I must admit, I used to think of it as a job title too, but I've learned much since then. What kind of activities do you expect to hire this new person to perform?

- Build out and maintain your Jenkins / Travis / et al server?
- Build out and maintain your Artifactory / et al server?
- Build out and maintain various build scripts in your system?
