I believe we are experiencing a diversity crisis in this field. Too few voices and life perspectives shaping the devices and software we use every day to live our lives and do our jobs.

People will make assumptions about you, some judgement based on your appearance. If you're a woman. If you're asian. If you're non-binary. If you're heavy. If you're black. These judgements may pigeon-hole you into certain expectations.

Even when you get into this field, you will find yourself judged based on a job title.

You're a woman and a "senior developer". You're black and a "tester". You're asian and a "UX designer". One more label, one more set of judgements about who you are as a professional and as a person.

You are not your labels.

No matter how many labels you wear, some part of you will always be erased behind them.
